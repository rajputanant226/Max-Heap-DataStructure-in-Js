🔺 Max Heap Data Structure
📘 Overview

A Max Heap is a specialized binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property —

Every parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes.

It is commonly used to implement priority queues, where the highest priority element is always at the top.

🧠 Key Concepts
🔹 Properties of Max Heap

Complete Binary Tree:
All levels are completely filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.

Heap Property:
The value of each parent node ≥ the value of its children.

Root Node:
Always contains the maximum element in the heap.
🚀 Applications

Priority Queues

Heap Sort Algorithm

Graph Algorithms (like Dijkstra’s shortest path)

Job Scheduling Systems

Median Finding using Heaps

🏁 Key Takeaways

A Max Heap ensures fast access to the largest element.

Insertion and deletion take O(log n) time due to tree height.

Can be efficiently represented as an array instead of using pointers.
